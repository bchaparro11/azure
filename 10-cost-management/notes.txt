1. Factors that affect cost:
    1. Time
    2. Consumption (Storage, Compute, Bandwidth)
    3. Service Tier:
        1. Basic
        2. Standard
        3. Premium
    4. Computing Power (vCPUs/RAM/CPU type)
    5. Software Licenses
    6. Bandwith (Egress from Azure)
    7. Bandwith (Between Azure Regions)
    8. IP Addresses
    9. Reservations (It means to reserve services without using them)
    10. Per transaction
2. Things that are free:
    1. Ingress bandwith is free
    2. First 5 GB outbound is free
    3. There are free and cheap options for many things (i.e. Free distros of Linux and paid distros of Linux)
3. Caveats:
    1. There are DEV software licenses for some things (like SQL server)
    2. There usually four or five ways to implement a technique (with tradeoffs for SLA and latency)
    3. Many services have multiple pricing options (monthly or consumption)
4. It's impossible to know exactly how much something is going to cost, but we can have a certainty of the value

5. There are two calculators in Azure:
    1. The one used to calculate how much the costs will be using Azure Cloud --> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/
    2. The one used to calculate how much the costs will be managing everything on-prem way --> https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/tco/calculator/

6. Azure Cost Management:
    1. The more I spend the more information I find on Azure Cost Management Dashboard
    2. I could set a budget to stop any unexpected increase
    3. I could schedule reports
    4. I could use resource tags to group to different client accounts
