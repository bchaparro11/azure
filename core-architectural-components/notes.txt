1. Not every region suppports Availability Zones
2. Not every service supports Availability Zones
3. I could create an availability architecture by choosing the right zones or regions
4. There are three types of AZ services:
    1. Zonal Services (I have to desing the availability trough the local zones)
    2. Zone-Redundant Services (Azure designs the availability architecture for us in an specific zone)
    3. Always Available Services (Same as previous one, but globally. Always are available everywhere. This are also called "Non-regional-services"). E.g.:
        1. Azure Portal
        2. Azure Active Directory
        3. Azure Front Door
5. Some services give you the choice between zonal and zone-redundant services.
