1. The term of identity is a concern given to:
    1. People
    2. Applications
    3. Devices
2. Ways to approve access to certain resources:
    1. Password
    2. Secret Key
    3. Certificate
3. Microsoft uses something called Active Directory to verify the identities. The homolgous in cloud is called:
    1. Active Directory --> Microsoft Entra ID (it was called in the past as Azure Active Directory, they changed it)
4. Active Directory and Microsoft Entra are not direct replacements of each other. They are similar but not equal
5. On-prem Active Directory uses protocols (like LDAP or Kerberos) that are not going to work over the internet
6. Microsoft Entra uses protocols, like SAML and Oauth, that do work over the internet

7. I can login to Entra ID using another platform like Facebook, for instance.
8. Entra ID uses AI to check "login patterns" in order to prevent any kind of threats. Suspicious patterns like:
    1. Repeatedly login
    2. Repeatedly logout
9. Local Active Directory used are gonna be synchronized seemlessly with Entra ID. Users are gonna be updated or deleted at once if it's done in any location
10. I could synchronize Entra ID with any other service in azure
11. Ways to authenticate these days:
    1. MFA --> We don't have to pay for using this. It's a free feature in Azure
        1. Factors (selected way to use MFA) that can be used in MFA:
            1. Microsoft Authentication App
            2. Authenticator Lite (in Outlook)
            3. Windows Hello for Business --> This is secure because it's carved in the hardware of our machine. So, we must have access physically to our machine to use this factor.
            4. FIDO2 security key
            5. OATH hardware token (in preview)
            6. OATH software token --> This is the one that you installed in your phone. An application different to Microsoft Authentication App
            7. SMS
            8. Voice call
    2. Thumbprint identification
    3. Face recognition

12. Entra ID Conditional Access
    1. It's a service to verify the (to measure the danger of a logged in):
        1. Location
        2. Device
        3. Measuring the range of time passed since a last logged in to Entra ID
        4. More on
    2. It's an additional service that has to be paid to be used

13. Passwordless authentication
    1. To authenticate in Azure without using a password. The ways to do it are:
        1. To draw some patterns in our cellphone
        2. To type a PIN
        3. Biometric recognition (face, iris, fingerprint). --> This isn't saved by Azure because I have to save this biometric information in my cellphone, and my cellphone is the responsible of the recognition process
        4. Auto-lock when I'm away of my devices (via Bluetooh)
