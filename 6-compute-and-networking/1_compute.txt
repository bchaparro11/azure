1. Some compute types:
    1. Virtual machines (VM) --> It's an IaaS. There are 700 options to chose
    2. VM Scale Sets (VMSS) --> It's Elasticity
        1. Scaling up --> Vertical Scaling
        2. Scaling out --> Horizontal Scaling
        3. We can scale based on:
            1. Demand
            2. Schedule
            3. More
        4. By default can handle up to 100 VMs. Could be configured to handle 1000 VMs. If we need more, we should add more scale sets.
    3. App services (Web apps) --> It's a PaaS
        1. This a product designed to be run in azure only
        2. We only have to set the configurations and that's it
        3. We can FTP here
        4. It's makes development cycle easier
    4. Container Services --> The main services are (kepp in mind there are more):
        1. Azure container instances (ACI)
        2. Azure container apps
        3. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
    5. Azure Virtual Desktop
        1. To have an UI in cloud
        2. I could access from celphones using iOS or Android by the application.
2. Availability Sets:
    1. A way to allocate a group of VMs to keep them isolated from each other.
3. Proximity Group:
    1. To allocate a group of VMs to keep them grouped one to another (the same rack).
    3. The benefit it has is to obtain the fastest inter-server communication.
    4. The trade-off this way has is to take the risk of availability because the rack could undergo an outage, so there's no replication to keep a high availability approach.
