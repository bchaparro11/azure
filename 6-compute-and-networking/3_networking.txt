1. This is an IaaS
2. Sometimes called VNets (Virtual Networks)
3. Two VMs in Azure are not allowed to talk to each other
4. In azure, it's virtual because it's effectively just a database entry in a table that establishes the path between VM A and VM B
5. It's IPv4 or IPv6
6. I don't have to be stingy when assigning VNets because there's no shortage. There are millions of private IP adresses
7. All virtual machines must belong to at least one subnet, using a Network Interface Card (NIC)
8. Some VMs have more than one subnet
9. VMs can optionally be assigned a public IP, which makes it eligible to be accesed from outside Azure (I need a firewall here).

10. Network Security Group (NSG)
    1. It's an access control list (ACL) that blocks the traffic inbound and outbound
11. I can allow communication between different subnets on the same network through adding specific NSG rules
12. No traffic passes the NSG filter unless an "ALLOW" rule matches
13. Rules have priorities, and the highest priority rule that matches is the one that applies.
