1. Some compute types:
    1. Virtual machines (VM) --> It's an IaaS. There are 700 options to chose
    2. VM Scale Sets (VMSS): --> It's Elasticity
        1. Scaling up --> Vertical Scaling
        2. Scaling out --> Horizontal Scaling
        3. We can scale based on:
            1. Demand
            2. Schedule
            3. More
        4. By default can handle up to 100 VMs. Could be configured to handle 1000 VMs. If we need more, we should add more scale sets.
    3. App services (Web apps)
    4. Azure container instances (ACI)
    5. Azure container apps
    6. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
